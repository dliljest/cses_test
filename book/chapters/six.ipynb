    "This book has equipped users with skills to elevate their understanding of National-scale streamflow modeling using the Community-Streamflow-Evaluation-System package. By navigating the intricacies of hydrological modeling challenges and leveraging the National Water Model, users my assess predictive performance across different hydrological classes. With a focus on three evaluation methods, this tutorial empowers you to enhance regional hydrological modeling skills, paving the way for more accurate predictions in critical areas such as stormflow, water supply, emergency management, and flood forecasting. We encourage users to expand on the scope of the tutorial and explore more detailed analyses to further streamflow prediction capabilities, and contribute to advancements in water resource management.\n"
