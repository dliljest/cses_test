    "National-scale streamflow modeling remains a modern challenge, as changes in the underlying hydrology from land use and land cover (LULC) change, anthropogentic streamflow modification, and general process components (reach length, hydrogeophysical processes, precipitation, temperature, etc) greatly influence hydrological modeling. In a changing climate, there is a need to anticipate flood intensity, impacts of groundwater depletion on streamflow, western mountain low-flow events, eastern rain-on-snow events, storm-induced flooding, and other severe environmental problems that challenge the management of water resources. Given the National Water Model (NWM) bridges the gap between the spatially coarse USGS streamflow observations by providing a near-continuous 2.7 million reach predictions of streamflow using the standardized NHDPlus framework, there lies the potential to improve upon the capabilities of the model by characterizing predictive performance across the heterogeneity of processes and land covers present at the national scale. The python-based Community-Streamflow-Evaluation-System package provides a foundation to evaluate national hydrography dataset (nhd) based model outputs with colocated USGS/NWIS streamflow monitoring stations (parameter: 060) without the need to download in-situ or NWM v2.1 data (NWM v3.0 coming soon!). The package contains three key methods for evaluation: state-based LULC, HUC level analysis, and USGS station-based analysis. Below is a description of each method and application. Designed to assess NWM version 2.1 retrospective performance, by using the exemplified data model the tool can evaluate other model predictions, with the motivation to improve regionally dominant hydrological modeling skill. By using Community-Streamflow-Evaluation-System, researchers can identify locations where a model may benefit from further training/calibration/parameterization or a need for new model processes/features (e.g., integration of reservoir release operations) to ultimately create new post-processing methods and/or hydrological modeling formulations to improve streamflow prediction capabilities with respect to modeling needs (e.g., stormflow, supply, emergency management, flooding, etc).\n",
