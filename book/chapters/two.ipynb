    "### Virtual Environment\n",
    "It is a best practice to create a virtual environment when starting a new project, as a virtual environment essentially creates an isolated working copy of Python for a particular project. I.e., each environment can have its own dependencies or even its own Python versions. Creating a Python virtual environment is useful if you need different versions of Python or packages for different projects. Lastly, a virtual environment keeps things tidy, makes sure your main Python installation stays healthy and supports reproducible and open science.\n",
